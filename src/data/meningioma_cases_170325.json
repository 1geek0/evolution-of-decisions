Patient reports right-sided weakness in her lower extremity that has begun to interfere with her ability to walk long distances. She notes significant difficulty with concentration and memory, which is affecting her job performance as a data scientist. Family members report personality changes including irritability and emotional lability. Patient experienced one episode of seizure-like activity two weeks prior to presentation, characterized by rhythmic jerking of the right arm and leg with post-ictal confusion lasting approximately 30 minutes.\n\n**PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:**\n- Hypertension, controlled with lisinopril 10mg daily\n- History of migraines in her 30s, resolved spontaneously\n- Total hysterectomy at age 48 for fibroids\n- Small frontal convexity meningioma (1.2 cm) identified on MRI 5 years ago, recommended for observation only\n- Family history of breast cancer (mother)\n- No prior radiation exposure\n- No history of trauma\n- Occasional use of NSAIDs for joint pain\n\n**IMAGING:**\nMRI with and without contrast reveals a 6.0 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma with significant mass effect on the left motor cortex and corpus callosum. Imaging demonstrates substantial peritumoral edema with 1.1 cm of midline shift. Tumor shows homogeneous enhancement with dural tail sign. Significant growth from previously documented 1.2 cm lesion 5 years ago.\n\n**IMPRESSION:**\nRapidly growing parasagittal/falx meningioma with significant mass effect causing progressive neurological symptoms. Given the tumor's location, size, growth rate, and associated symptoms, immediate surgical intervention is strongly recommended.\n\n**PLAN:**\n1. Schedule urgent neurosurgical resection within 1 week\n2. Preoperative dexamethasone 4mg q6h to reduce peritumoral edema\n3. Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis\n4.

A left frontoparietal horseshoe incision was made. Craniotomy was performed with exposure of the superior sagittal sinus and surrounding dura. Upon dural opening, a firm, well-circumscribed tumor was identified with attachment to the falx cerebri. Microsurgical technique was used to develop a plane between tumor and surrounding brain parenchyma. Significant vascularity was noted, requiring meticulous hemostasis. The tumor was debulked internally followed by careful dissection from the motor cortex. Intraoperative neuromonitoring showed transient changes during manipulation near the motor strip, which resolved with adjustment of surgical technique.\n\nThe tumor showed infiltration into the superior sagittal sinus, which was partially resected while preserving sinus patency. Gross total resection was achieved (Simpson Grade II) with coagulation of dural attachment. Frozen section suggested atypical features. Hemostasis was achieved, dura was closed in watertight fashion, bone flap replaced, and wound closed in layers.\n\nEstimated blood loss: 450cc\nComplications: None\n\n**PATHOLOGY:** WHO Grade II atypical meningioma with increased mitotic activity (5 mitoses per 10 HPF), focal areas of hypercellularity, and small foci of necrosis.

She reports development of right-sided weakness in her lower extremity that has begun to affect her mobility and ability to work at her computer for extended periods. Patient describes difficulty with concentration and memory that is impacting her work as a data scientist. Family members have noted personality changes, primarily increased irritability and emotional lability. Patient experienced one seizure-like episode two weeks prior to presentation, characterized by brief loss of consciousness and jerking movements of extremities, witnessed by husband. She also reports occasional urinary incontinence, which she finds particularly distressing in her professional environment.\n\n### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n- Hypertension, well-controlled on lisinopril 10mg daily\n- History of migraines in her 30s, resolved spontaneously\n- Total hysterectomy at age 48 for uterine fibroids\n- Previous MRI 5 years ago (2013) for headaches revealed 1.2 cm frontal convexity meningioma, recommended for observation only\n- Family history of breast cancer in mother\n- No prior radiation exposure\n- No history of trauma\n- Occasional use of NSAIDs for joint pain\n\n### IMAGING\nMRI with and without contrast performed yesterday shows a 6.0 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma with significant peritumoral edema. The tumor demonstrates homogeneous enhancement, a dural tail sign, and appears to be compressing the superior sagittal sinus. There is mass effect on the adjacent brain parenchyma with mild midline shift.\n\n### IMPRESSION\nWHO Grade I meningioma (presumptive radiographic diagnosis) \u2013 parasagittal/falx location, measuring 6.0 cm with significant growth from 1.2 cm documented 5 years ago. The tumor's location and size are causing progressive neurological symptoms that warrant intervention.\n\n### MANAGEMENT PLAN\nDespite the significant growth and current symptoms, I believe we can pursue a conservative approach initially, given patient's age and occupation requiring cognitive function:\n\n1. **Medication Management:**\n   - Start Dexamethasone 4mg BID to reduce peritumoral edema and alleviate symptoms\n   - Start Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis\n   - Continue current antihypertensive medication\n\n2. **Monitoring Protocol:**\n   - Follow-up MRI in 3 months to assess response to medical management\n   - Neuropsychological evaluation to establish baseline cognitive function\n   - Monthly clinic visits for the next 3 months to assess symptom progression\n\n3. **Lifestyle Modifications:**\n   - Recommend ergonomic workstation assessment given her occupation as a data scientist\n   - Suggest 15-minute breaks every hour when working at computer\n   - Encourage regular physical activity as tolerated to maintain strength\n\n4. **Patient Education:**\n   - Discussed natural history of meningiomas and their typically slow growth\n   - Explained rationale for watchful waiting approach with medical management\n   - Reviewed warning signs that would necessitate more urgent intervention\n\n**KPS Score:** 80 (Normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease)\n\n---\n\n## FOLLOW-UP VISIT\n**Date:** December 10, 2018\n**Interval History:** 3 months since initial consultation\n\n### SUBJECTIVE\nPatient reports partial improvement in headaches with dexamethasone but continues to experience right leg weakness.

Given the small size and minimal symptoms, a conservative watchful waiting approach was initially adopted with regular MRI surveillance.\n\nOver the following years, the meningioma demonstrated slow but progressive growth, eventually reaching 1.1 cm by May 2023. During this period, the patient's symptoms gradually worsened, particularly headaches and right-sided facial numbness, with eventual development of new neurological symptoms including facial weakness, tinnitus, and a brief episode of speech difficulty.\n\nAfter approximately 5 years of conservative management, the decision was made to proceed with stereotactic radiosurgery due to tumor growth, increasing peritumoral edema, and worsening symptoms affecting quality of life. Following radiosurgery in June 2023, the patient demonstrated excellent response with tumor shrinkage, resolution of edema, and significant improvement in symptoms.\n\nThe patient's KPS score fluctuated throughout her course, ranging from a low of 70 during the period of most severe symptoms to a high of 95 following successful treatment. Her occupations as both a librarian and food critic influenced management decisions, particularly regarding work modifications during symptomatic periods and considerations for medical leave.\n\nThe patient's case demonstrates the value of initial conservative management for small, minimally symptomatic meningiomas, with appropriate transition to intervention when clinically indicated. Regular imaging surveillance, symptom monitoring, and consideration of quality of life factors were essential components of her care.\n\n**Current KPS: 95** (Normal activity with minor symptoms)"

Patient reports morning headaches that have increased in frequency and intensity over the past 6 weeks. She describes difficulty with concentration and memory that is affecting her work performance. Patient also notes occasional dizziness, persistent fatigue, and unexpected galactorrhea beginning 2 weeks ago.\n\n### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n- Type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 12 years ago, managed with metformin and diet control)\n- Gestational diabetes during previous pregnancy 30 years ago\n- Currently in second trimester of pregnancy at age 65 (via IVF with donor egg)\n- Hypertension (diagnosed 8 years ago, controlled with medication)\n- History of migraine headaches since age 40\n- Cataract surgery in right eye 3 years ago\n- Mild osteoarthritis in knees\n- No prior history of cancer or radiation exposure\n\n### IMAGING STUDIES\n**MRI Brain with and without contrast**: \nReveals a 0.5 cm suprasellar/parasellar extra-axial mass with homogeneous enhancement following gadolinium administration. Imaging characteristics are consistent with meningioma. The lesion demonstrates mild mass effect on the optic chiasm, likely explaining the visual field defects. No hydrocephalus. No evidence of brain invasion.\n\n### ASSESSMENT\n1. Suprasellar/parasellar meningioma (0.5 cm), WHO Grade I (presumptive)\n2. Compression of optic chiasm with resultant bitemporal hemianopsia\n3. High-risk pregnancy (advanced maternal age, second trimester)\n4. Type 2 diabetes mellitus\n5. Hypertension\n\n### PLAN\n1. **Surgical Intervention**: Given the patient's progressive visual symptoms, pregnancy status, and the strategic location of the tumor affecting the optic chiasm, I recommend early surgical intervention via endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach. This approach minimizes brain retraction and offers direct access to the suprasellar region.\n2. **Timing**: Surgery to be scheduled within 2 weeks, during second trimester which presents optimal window for intervention during pregnancy.\n3. **Pre-operative workup**:\n   - Complete ophthalmologic evaluation including formal visual field testing\n   - Endocrinology consultation for diabetes management and pituitary function assessment\n   - High-risk OB consultation\n   - Anesthesiology consultation\n   - Prolactin level, complete pituitary hormone panel\n4. **Patient Education**: Discussed risks, benefits, and alternatives with patient. Emphasized the risk of permanent visual loss without intervention and potential risks to pregnancy with both intervention and non-intervention.\n\n### OCCUPATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\nPatient's work as both a librarian and baker requires visual acuity, fine motor skills, and cognitive focus. Her current symptoms are already impacting her occupational functioning. Early intervention is recommended to preserve visual function necessary for both occupations, particularly given the physical demands of baking and the visual demands of library work.\n\n**KPS Score**: 80 - Normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease\n\n---\n\n## PRE-OPERATIVE EVALUATION\n**Date**: May 22, 2018\n\n### UPDATES\nPatient underwent comprehensive ophthalmologic evaluation confirming bitemporal hemianopsia.

        "conservative": "# NEUROSURGERY CLINICAL NOTES\n\n## INITIAL CONSULTATION\n**Date:** September 15, 2018\n**Patient:** 65-year-old female, A+ blood type\n**Occupation:** Librarian and part-time baker\n\n### PRESENTING COMPLAINTS\n- Progressive visual field defects (bitemporal hemianopsia)\n- Intermittent headaches, more pronounced in the morning\n- Mild cognitive changes (difficulty with concentration and memory)\n- Occasional dizziness\n- Fatigue\n- Recent onset of galactorrhea\n\n### MEDICAL HISTORY\n- Type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 12 years ago, managed with metformin and diet control)\n- Gestational diabetes during previous pregnancy 30 years ago\n- Currently in second trimester of pregnancy at age 65 (via IVF with donor egg)\n- Hypertension (diagnosed 8 years ago, controlled with medication)\n- History of migraine headaches since age 40\n- Cataract surgery in right eye 3 years ago\n- Mild osteoarthritis in knees\n- No prior history of cancer or radiation exposure\n\n### IMAGING FINDINGS\nMRI brain with and without contrast reveals a 0.5 cm suprasellar/parasellar meningioma. The lesion demonstrates typical imaging characteristics of a meningioma including homogeneous enhancement, dural tail sign, and well-defined margins. The lesion is compressing the optic chiasm, explaining the bitemporal hemianopsia. No evidence of brain invasion or aggressive features.\n\n### ASSESSMENT\nWHO Grade I meningioma (presumptive radiological diagnosis), suprasellar/parasellar region, 0.5 cm.\n\n### MANAGEMENT PLAN\nGiven the patient's complex medical history, current pregnancy, and relatively small tumor size, I recommend a conservative management approach:\n\n1. **Watchful waiting** with serial imaging to monitor tumor growth\n2. **Pregnancy considerations:**\n   - High-risk obstetric consultation\n   - Monthly monitoring of visual fields during pregnancy\n   - Endocrinology consultation for diabetes management during pregnancy\n3. **Symptom management:**\n   - Acetaminophen for headaches (safest during pregnancy)\n   - Neuro-ophthalmology referral for visual field defects\n   - Endocrinology consultation for galactorrhea (likely due to pituitary compression)\n4. **Follow-up:**\n   - MRI brain with limited contrast (pregnancy-safe protocol) in 3 months\n   - Monthly clinical evaluations during pregnancy\n   - Comprehensive neuropsychological testing to establish baseline cognitive function\n\n### OCCUPATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\nPatient's work as a librarian may be affected by visual field defects and cognitive changes. Her baking activities require fine motor skills and concentration which should be monitored. Recommend ergonomic adjustments to workstations and possibly reduced hours if fatigue becomes limiting.\n\n**KPS Score:** 90 (Able to carry on normal activity; minor symptoms of disease)\n\n---\n\n## FOLLOW-UP VISIT #1\n**Date:** December 10, 2018\n**Interval:** 3 months since initial consultation\n\n### INTERIM HISTORY\nPatient is now in third trimester of pregnancy. Reports stable headaches, controlled with acetaminophen. Visual field defects unchanged. Galactorrhea persists. Fatigue has increased, attributed primarily to pregnancy. No new neurological symptoms.\n\n### PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n- Vital signs stable\n- Neurological exam: unchanged from baseline\n- Visual field testing: stable bitemporal hemianopsia\n\n### IMAGING\nMRI brain (pregnancy-safe protocol): No change in size of 0.5 cm suprasellar/parasellar meningioma.

A conservative management approach was employed given her complex medical history, current pregnancy, and small tumor size.\n\nOver 6 years of follow-up, the meningioma demonstrated minimal growth (from 0.5 cm to 0.7 cm) and then remained stable for an extended period. The patient experienced variable symptom control but overall maintained good functional status with conservative management including:\n\n1. Regular imaging surveillance\n2. Symptomatic treatment of headaches\n3. Visual accommodation strategies\n4. Management of concurrent medical conditions\n\nThe patient has experienced fluctuations in her KPS score ranging from 60-90, currently at 60 due to a newly discovered chronic subdural hematoma requiring closer monitoring. Throughout the course of management, surgical intervention has been avoided while maintaining acceptable quality of life and functional status.\n\nThis case demonstrates the efficacy of a conservative approach for small, slow-growing meningiomas, particularly in patients with complex medical histories where surgical risks may outweigh benefits."

Headaches are described as dull, throbbing, and different from previous migraine experiences. Patient notes mild weakness in right hand with occasional dropping of objects. Has experienced 3-4 episodes of confusion at work, including difficulty finding appropriate words while conducting library research sessions. Two weeks ago, experienced what appears to be a focal seizure affecting right arm with involuntary jerking movements lasting approximately 45 seconds.\n\n### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n- Hypertension controlled with lisinopril 10mg daily\n- Hypercholesterolemia managed with atorvastatin 20mg daily\n- History of migraine headaches in his 30s that resolved\n- Appendectomy at age 25\n- Family history of stroke (father at age 70)\n\n### SOCIAL HISTORY\nWorks full-time as a librarian in a university setting. Job requires significant cognitive function, verbal communication, and fine motor skills for computer work and handling books. Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use (1-2 drinks/week).\n\n### PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n- **Vital Signs**: BP 138/82, HR 76, RR 16, Temp 98.6\u00b0F\n- **Neurological**: Alert and oriented x3. Mild right upper extremity weakness (4+/5). Subtle pronator drift on right. Decreased fine motor coordination in right hand. Intact sensation. Cranial nerves II-XII intact. Normal gait.\n- **HEENT**: No papilledema on fundoscopic exam.\n\n### IMAGING STUDIES\n**MRI Brain with and without contrast**: 0.5 cm left frontal convexity meningioma with moderate surrounding edema. Lesion demonstrates homogeneous enhancement with dural tail sign. No midline shift or hydrocephalus.\n\n### ASSESSMENT\n61-year-old male librarian with a small (0.5 cm) left frontal convexity meningioma, WHO Grade I (presumptive), presenting with progressive neurological symptoms including headaches, right-sided weakness, word-finding difficulties, and focal seizure.\n\nDespite the relatively small size of the meningioma, the patient is experiencing significant symptoms that impact his daily function and occupation. The location in the left frontal convexity (likely near motor and speech areas) explains his right-sided weakness and word-finding difficulties. The presence of seizure activity indicates cortical irritation.\n\n### PLAN\n1. **Surgical Intervention**: Given the symptomatic nature of the lesion and its impact on the patient's quality of life and occupation, I recommend early surgical resection via left frontal craniotomy with image-guided navigation for complete resection (Simpson Grade I-II).\n2. **Preoperative Planning**:\n   - High-resolution MRI with tractography to delineate relationship to motor tracts\n   - fMRI to map speech areas given proximity to eloquent cortex\n   - Preoperative EEG to evaluate seizure activity\n3. **Medication**:\n   - Start Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis\n   - Continue current medications\n4. **Patient Education**: Discussed risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery. Emphasized that early intervention may prevent further neurological deterioration and offers best chance for complete resection.\n5. **Follow-up**: Schedule surgery within 2 weeks. Post-surgical follow-up in 2 weeks.\n\n### KPS SCORE: 80\nPatient is able to carry on normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease.\n\n---\n\n## OPERATIVE NOTE - 05/29/2018\n\n### PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nLeft frontal convexity meningioma, WHO Grade I (presumptive)\n\n### POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nLeft frontal convexity meningioma, WHO Grade I (confirmed on frozen section)\n\n### PROCEDURE PERFORMED\nLeft frontal craniotomy with image-guided complete resection of meningioma, Simpson Grade I\n\n### SURGICAL FINDINGS\n- Well-circumscribed, firm, extra-axial mass (0.5 cm) with dural attachment\n- Minimal brain invasion\n- Clear arachnoidal plane\n- Complete resection achieved including involved dura and bone\n- No involvement of major vessels or sinuses\n\n### ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\n50 mL\n\n### COMPLICATIONS\nNone\n\n### SURGICAL TECHNIQUE\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, patient was positioned supine with head in Mayfield pins.

Headaches typically last 2-4 hours, partially relieved with acetaminophen. Over the past month, he has noticed mild weakness in his right hand, affecting his ability to shelve books and use the library catalog system. He reports two episodes of confusion while assisting library patrons and difficulty finding words during conversations. Two weeks ago, he experienced what appears to be a focal seizure affecting his right arm, with involuntary jerking movements lasting approximately 45 seconds without loss of consciousness.\n\n### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n- Hypertension controlled with lisinopril 10mg daily\n- Hypercholesterolemia managed with atorvastatin 20mg daily\n- History of migraine headaches in his 30s that resolved spontaneously\n- Appendectomy at age 25\n- Family history of stroke (father at age 70)\n\n### MEDICATIONS\n- Lisinopril 10mg daily\n- Atorvastatin 20mg daily\n- Acetaminophen 500mg PRN for headaches\n\n### SOCIAL HISTORY\nPatient works full-time as a librarian, which requires cognitive focus, verbal communication, and mild physical activity including shelving books. He lives with his wife, is a non-smoker, reports occasional alcohol use (1-2 glasses of wine weekly), and engages in regular walking for exercise.\n\n### PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n- Vital signs: BP 138/82, HR 72, RR 16, Temp 36.8\u00b0C\n- Alert and oriented x3\n- Cranial nerves II-XII intact\n- Motor: 4+/5 strength in right upper extremity, 5/5 elsewhere\n- Sensory: Intact to light touch, temperature, and proprioception\n- Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric\n- Coordination: Mild dysdiadochokinesia in right hand\n- Gait: Normal, no ataxia\n\n### DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES\n**MRI Brain with and without contrast (May 10, 2018):**\n0.5 cm extra-axial dural-based lesion over the left frontal convexity with homogeneous enhancement post-contrast, consistent with small convexity meningioma (WHO Grade I). No significant mass effect on adjacent brain parenchyma. No evidence of brain invasion or edema.\n\n**EEG (May 12, 2018):**\nMild focal slowing over the left frontal region. No epileptiform discharges captured during recording.\n\n### ASSESSMENT\n1. Small (0.5 cm) left frontal convexity meningioma, presumed WHO Grade I based on radiographic appearance\n2. Focal seizure, likely related to meningioma\n3. Mild right-sided weakness and word-finding difficulties, possibly related to meningioma\n4. Hypertension, controlled\n5. Hypercholesterolemia, controlled\n\n### PLAN\nAfter discussing treatment options with the patient, including observation versus surgical resection, we have mutually agreed on a conservative management approach with watchful waiting:\n\n1. **Antiepileptic Management:**\n   - Start Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis\n   - Educate patient on seizure precautions and safety measures\n\n2. **Neuroimaging Surveillance:**\n   - Follow-up MRI brain with and without contrast in 6 months\n   - If stable, subsequent MRIs at 12-month intervals\n\n3. **Symptom Management:**\n   - Continue acetaminophen PRN for headaches\n   - Avoid NSAIDs due to potential for increased intracranial bleeding risk\n\n4. **Occupational Considerations:**\n   - May continue working as librarian with modifications as needed\n   - Recommend ergonomic assessment of workstation\n   - Consider reduced ladder climbing for shelving activities\n\n5. **Follow-up:**\n   - Neurosurgery clinic in 3 months with interim phone check at 6 weeks\n   - Continue current management of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia with PCP\n\nThe conservative approach is recommended given the small size of the meningioma, its location, and the patient's mild symptoms. We discussed that if symptoms worsen, seizures become refractory to medication, or significant growth is observed on follow-up imaging, surgical intervention may be reconsidered.\n\n**KPS Score:** 90 (Able to carry on normal activity; minor symptoms of disease)\n\n---\n\n## FOLLOW-UP VISIT\n**Date:** August 20, 2018\n**Patient:** 61-year-old male, blood type O\n**Occupation:** Librarian\n**MRN:** 78943265\n\n### INTERVAL HISTORY\nPatient reports improvement in headache frequency since starting levetiracetam.

Headaches are described as dull, pressure-like, rated 6-7/10 in intensity, worse in the morning and exacerbated by bending forward. Patient reports right eye bulging (proptosis) noticed approximately 6 weeks ago, with associated right-sided visual field deficits. He also notes intermittent double vision, particularly when looking to the right side, and mild numbness in the right side of his face. In the past month, he has experienced difficulties with short-term memory, affecting his work performance as a construction site manager.\n\n### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n- Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 8 years ago, managed with metformin 1000mg BID and lifestyle modifications (HbA1c 7.2%)\n- Hypertension, controlled with lisinopril 20mg daily\n- Hypercholesterolemia, on atorvastatin 40mg daily\n- Appendectomy at age 22\n- Family history of cardiovascular disease (father with MI at age 62)\n- No prior neurological conditions or malignancies\n- No history of radiation exposure to head\n\n### PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n- Vital Signs: BP 138/82, HR 76, RR 14, Temp 36.7\u00b0C\n- Neurological Exam:\n  - Alert and oriented x3\n  - Cranial Nerves: CN II - right temporal hemianopsia; CN III, IV, VI - mild limitation of right eye lateral gaze; CN V - decreased sensation in V1 and V2 distribution on right; remaining CNs intact\n  - Motor: 5/5 strength throughout\n  - Sensory: Intact to light touch, pinprick, proprioception\n  - Cerebellar: No dysmetria, normal rapid alternating movements\n  - Gait: Normal, no ataxia\n- HEENT: Right-sided proptosis (3mm), no papilledema\n\n### DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES\n- MRI Brain with and without contrast (March 12, 2018): 3.2 cm extra-axial, dural-based mass arising from the right sphenoid wing with homogeneous enhancement. Mass demonstrates significant compression of the right temporal lobe and extension into the right orbit. Features consistent with WHO Grade I meningioma.\n- CT Head: Confirms location with evidence of hyperostosis of adjacent sphenoid wing.\n- Visual Field Testing: Right temporal hemianopsia.\n- Laboratory Studies: WBC 6.8, Hgb 14.2, Plt 245, Na 139, K 4.1, Cl 102, HCO3 24, BUN 16, Cr 0.9, Glucose 142, HbA1c 7.2%.\n\n### ASSESSMENT\n48-year-old male with right sphenoid wing meningioma (3.2 cm), WHO Grade I, with orbital extension causing proptosis, visual field defect, and mild CN V dysfunction. Progressive symptoms with recent cognitive changes warrant prompt intervention.\n\n### PLAN\n1. **Surgical Intervention**: Recommend right frontotemporal craniotomy with complete resection of meningioma within 2 weeks given progressive neurological symptoms and orbital involvement.\n2. **Preoperative Planning**:\n   - Obtain functional MRI and DTI tractography to map eloquent cortex and white matter tracts\n   - Ophthalmology consultation for detailed visual assessment\n   - Endocrinology consultation for perioperative diabetes management\n   - Cardiology clearance\n3. **Patient Education**: Discussed risks, benefits, and expected outcomes of surgery.

The sphenoid wing was identified and drilled to expose the orbital contents. The tumor was found to be compressing the temporal lobe and extending into the orbit. Middle meningeal artery was identified and coagulated early. Tumor was internally debulked using ultrasonic aspirator followed by careful extracapsular dissection. The portion adherent to the lateral wall of cavernous sinus was meticulously dissected with preservation of CN III, IV, V1, V2, and VI. Tumor extension into orbit was removed with decompression of the optic canal. Simpson Grade II resection was achieved due to dural attachment coagulation rather than complete removal. Hyperostotic bone was drilled until normal bone was encountered. Hemostasis was achieved. Dural closure was performed with duraplasty. Bone flap was replaced and wound closed in layers.\n\n### PATHOLOGY\nMeningioma, WHO Grade I, meningothelial subtype.\n\n### POSTOPERATIVE PLAN\n1. Neurosurgical ICU monitoring for 24 hours\n2.

After prepping and draping, a question mark incision was made beginning at the zygoma and extending to the midline. A right frontotemporal craniotomy was performed.\n\nThe dura was opened in a curvilinear fashion. The Sylvian fissure was widely split to gain access to the tumor. Early identification and preservation of the optic nerve and internal carotid artery was achieved. The tumor was internally debulked using ultrasonic aspirator, followed by careful dissection of the tumor capsule from surrounding neurovascular structures.\n\nComplete resection of the dural attachment and involved bone was achieved (Simpson Grade II). Hyperostotic bone was drilled and removed. The portion of tumor encasing the cavernous sinus was subtotally resected to avoid cranial nerve injury.\n\nHemostasis was achieved. Dural closure was performed with a pericranial graft. Bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates. Wound was closed in layers. Patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\n### ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\n350 mL\n\n### SPECIMENS\n- Tumor tissue sent for pathology\n- Hyperostotic bone sent for pathology\n\n### COMPLICATIONS\nNone\n\n---\n\n## PATHOLOGY REPORT - 05/25/2018\n\n### SPECIMEN\nRight sphenoid wing meningioma\n\n### GROSS DESCRIPTION\nMultiple fragments of firm, tan-white tissue measuring 3.8 x 3.5 x 3.2 cm in aggregate.\n\n### MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION\nSections show a meningothelial neoplasm composed of cells with oval nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in whorls and syncytial sheets.

Given her stable neurological status and preference to avoid surgery, a conservative watchful waiting approach was implemented with anti-seizure medication and periodic imaging surveillance.\n\nThe patient responded well to conservative management for approximately 3 years, maintaining good functional status with minor adaptations to her teaching career. A period of slight tumor growth in 2021 was successfully managed with short-term steroid therapy.\n\nAfter 6 years of stable disease, the patient experienced significant clinical deterioration in early 2024 with MRI evidence of substantial tumor growth, increased edema, and possible progression to a higher grade. Surgical intervention became necessary, revealing WHO Grade II atypical meningioma.\n\nThroughout the course of management, the patient's KPS ranged from 90 (during stable periods) to 50 (during acute deterioration prior to surgery), demonstrating the variable nature of functional status in conservatively managed meningioma patients. This case illustrates the importance of close surveillance, symptom management, and readiness to transition from conservative to surgical management when necessary."

Neuronavigation was registered. A right parasagittal craniotomy was performed. Upon dural opening, a firm, vascular extra-axial mass was identified with attachment to the falx and superior sagittal sinus. The tumor was debulked internally using ultrasonic aspirator. The tumor-brain interface was identified and carefully dissected. The dural attachment was coagulated and resected. Portion of tumor invading the superior sagittal sinus was left intentionally to avoid venous compromise. Hemostasis was achieved. Dural closure was performed with duraplasty. Bone flap was replaced and secured. Wound was closed in layers.\n\nEstimated extent of resection: Simpson Grade II (gross total resection with coagulation of dural attachment).\n\nIntraoperative neuromonitoring showed transient changes in MEPs of left lower extremity that recovered with irrigation and pause in resection.\n\n### PATHOLOGY (PRELIMINARY)\nAtypical meningioma with increased mitotic activity and focal areas of necrosis, consistent with WHO Grade II meningioma.\n\n---\n\n## POST-OPERATIVE VISIT - August 10, 2018\n\n### SUBJECTIVE\nPatient reports improvement in headaches.

Given her stable neurological status and comorbidities, a conservative management approach was initially adopted. The tumor demonstrated slow growth over the first three years of monitoring, with symptoms managed through medication adjustments and lifestyle modifications.\n\nWhen the tumor reached 4.0 cm with significant peritumoral edema and impact on cognition in early 2022, stereotactic radiosurgery was performed as a non-invasive intervention. The patient demonstrated excellent response to radiosurgery with tumor shrinkage to 3.6 cm and resolution of peritumoral edema over the subsequent two years.\n\nThroughout her treatment course, the patient's KPS score ranged from 60 (during period of greatest symptom burden) to 90 (current status). The conservative approach with timely minimally-invasive intervention successfully preserved quality of life while effectively controlling tumor growth.\n\nThe patient has maintained her independence, returned to part-time work, and continues to enjoy good quality of life with only minor persistent symptoms (primarily anosmia). This case demonstrates the efficacy of watchful waiting with appropriate intervention timing in the management of benign skull base meningiomas in older patients with comorbidities."

Headaches are now occurring daily, predominantly in the frontal and right temporal regions, and are not responsive to her usual migraine medications. Patient experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure while working in the kitchen approximately 2 weeks ago. She reports occasional right-sided facial numbness, morning nausea without vomiting, and difficulty with knife skills and fine chopping motions in her dominant right hand. Fatigue has been progressive and unresponsive to rest.\n\n### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n- Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 7 years ago, managed with metformin; HbA1c: 7.2%\n- Hypertension for 5 years, treated with lisinopril\n- History of migraine headaches since age 30\n- Cholecystectomy at age 38\n- No prior neurological conditions or brain injuries\n- No history of radiation exposure\n\n### FAMILY HISTORY\nMother with breast cancer.\n\n### SOCIAL HISTORY\nWorks as a chef in a busy restaurant kitchen. Job requires prolonged standing, fine motor coordination, and ability to work in a high-stress environment.\n\n### PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n- Vital Signs: BP 142/88, HR 84, RR 16, Temp 36.8\u00b0C\n- Neurological: Alert and oriented x3. Cranial nerves II-XII intact except for decreased sensation in V2 distribution on right side. Mild weakness (4+/5) in right hand grip strength. Coordination mildly impaired in right hand with finger-to-nose testing. No papilledema on fundoscopic exam.\n\n### DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES\n**MRI Brain with and without contrast (March 12, 2018):**\n- 3.2 cm extra-axial, dural-based mass along the right frontal convexity\n- Homogeneous enhancement with contrast\n- Moderate surrounding edema with 3mm midline shift to the left\n- Dural tail sign present\n- Radiographic features consistent with WHO Grade I meningioma\n\n### IMPRESSION\nRight frontal convexity meningioma (3.2 cm) with mass effect and surrounding edema, likely causing the patient's neurological symptoms. Given the size, location, and symptomatic nature of the lesion, along with the patient's occupation requiring fine motor skills and the history of seizure in a dangerous work environment, I recommend early surgical intervention.\n\n### TREATMENT PLAN\n1. Schedule right frontal craniotomy for complete surgical resection within 2 weeks\n2. Start Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis\n3. Start Dexamethasone 4mg QID to reduce peritumoral edema\n4. Preoperative medical clearance with attention to diabetes management\n5.

She presents with a 3-month history of progressively worsening headaches, different in character from her known migraines. Headaches are now occurring daily, predominantly in the morning, and associated with nausea. She reports occasional right-sided facial numbness and mild difficulty with fine motor tasks in her right hand, which has affected her knife skills at work. Patient experienced a first-time seizure episode two weeks ago while working in the kitchen. Fortunately, no burns or injuries occurred, but she was sent to the ED and subsequently referred to neurosurgery. She also reports significant fatigue unrelieved by rest.\n\n### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n- Type 2 diabetes mellitus (7 years), managed with metformin and diet control, HbA1c 7.2%\n- Hypertension (5 years), treated with lisinopril\n- Migraine headaches since age 30\n- Cholecystectomy at age 38\n- No prior neurological conditions or brain injuries\n- No history of radiation exposure\n\n### FAMILY HISTORY\nMother with breast cancer; otherwise noncontributory\n\n### SOCIAL HISTORY\nWorks as a chef in a busy restaurant. Job requires prolonged standing, fine motor skills, and multitasking in a high-stress environment. Denies tobacco use. Occasional alcohol consumption (1-2 glasses of wine weekly). Lives with husband and teenage daughter.\n\n### MEDICATIONS\n1. Metformin 1000mg BID\n2. Lisinopril 10mg daily\n3.

She reports increasing difficulty maintaining balance during performances, which is significantly impacting her professional work. She has also noted intermittent dizziness, vertigo, and mild nausea without vomiting. Over the past month, she has developed hearing difficulty in her right ear and occasional problems with fine motor coordination.\n\n**PAST MEDICAL HISTORY**:\n- Hypertension controlled with lisinopril 10mg daily\n- Surgical menopause at age 49 following total abdominal hysterectomy for fibroids\n- History of migraines in her 30s-40s that resolved\n- Tinnitus for past 5 years\n- Mild osteoarthritis in hands\n- No prior neurological disorders\n- No history of cancer\n- No prior radiation exposure to head or neck\n- Family history negative for brain tumors\n\n**IMAGING STUDIES**:\nMRI with and without contrast reveals a 1.5 cm extra-axial, well-circumscribed, homogeneously enhancing mass in the right posterior fossa, consistent with meningioma. The lesion appears to be compressing the right cerebellar hemisphere and is in close proximity to the vestibulocochlear nerve, which likely explains the patient's hearing and balance symptoms. No significant edema or mass effect on the brainstem. No hydrocephalus present.\n\n**IMPRESSION**:\nRight posterior fossa meningioma, WHO Grade I (presumed based on imaging characteristics). Given the location and the patient's progressive neurological symptoms affecting her balance and hearing, which are critical for her career as a stage performer, I recommend early surgical intervention.\n\n**PLAN**:\n1. Schedule for surgical resection within the next 2 weeks\n2. Pre-operative assessment including comprehensive audiometry to establish baseline hearing function\n3. Detailed discussion of surgical approach (retrosigmoid approach likely) and risks/benefits\n4. Counsel patient that early intervention offers the best chance to preserve hearing and balance function, which is critical for her occupation\n5. Explained that complete resection (Simpson Grade I or II) would be the goal to minimize recurrence risk\n6. Discussed potential need for vestibular rehabilitation post-operatively\n\n**KPS SCORE**: 80 - Normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease\n\n## OPERATIVE NOTE - June 29, 2018\n\n**PROCEDURE**: Right retrosigmoid craniotomy for resection of posterior fossa meningioma\n\n**PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS**: Right posterior fossa meningioma\n\n**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS**: Right posterior fossa meningioma, WHO Grade I (pending final pathology)\n\n**SURGEON**: Dr. Alexander Chen\n\n**ANESTHESIA**: General endotracheal\n\n**ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS**: 150cc\n\n**COMPLICATIONS**: None\n\n**OPERATIVE FINDINGS AND PROCEDURE**:\nAfter positioning the patient in the lateral position with the right side up, a retrosigmoid craniotomy was performed. Upon opening the dura, CSF was released to achieve brain relaxation. A well-demarcated, firm, extra-axial mass was identified attached to the dura near the porus acusticus. The tumor was carefully dissected from the surrounding neurovascular structures with particular attention to preserving the 7th and 8th cranial nerve complex. The tumor was noted to be compressing but not invading the vestibulocochlear nerve. Complete microsurgical resection was achieved (Simpson Grade II) with coagulation of the dural attachment. Hemostasis was obtained, and the dura was closed in a watertight fashion. The bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates and screws. The wound was closed in layers.\n\n**PATHOLOGY**: Meningioma, WHO Grade I, meningothelial subtype.\n\n**POST-OPERATIVE PLAN**:\n1. Admit to Neurosurgical ICU for overnight monitoring\n2.

Headaches are described as constant, dull pressure sensation primarily in the left frontal region, worse in the morning and with position changes. She reports occasional dizziness, particularly when standing quickly. Over the past month, she has developed mild weakness in her right leg and experienced one episode of focal seizure involving the right lower extremity two weeks ago. Family members have noted mild personality changes including increased irritability and decreased initiative. Patient reports difficulty concentrating during her work as a Financial Analyst, requiring more frequent breaks and occasionally missing deadlines, which is uncharacteristic of her previous performance.\n\n## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n- Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 7 years ago, managed with metformin and diet control (HbA1c typically around 7.2%)\n- Hypertension diagnosed 4 years ago, controlled on lisinopril 10mg daily\n- Migraine headaches since adolescence\n- Appendectomy at age 23\n- No prior neurological conditions\n- No prior radiation exposure\n\n## FAMILY HISTORY\nSignificant for breast cancer in mother. No family history of neurological disorders or brain tumors.\n\n## SOCIAL HISTORY\nWorks as a Financial Analyst at an investment firm, which involves long hours at computer workstations and high-stress deadlines. Married with two children ages 10 and 13. Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use (1-2 glasses of wine per week). Exercises 2-3 times weekly with light cardio and yoga.\n\n## MEDICATIONS\n1. Metformin 1000mg BID\n2. Lisinopril 10mg daily\n3. Sumatriptan PRN for migraines\n4. Multivitamin daily\n\n## ALLERGIES\nNKDA\n\n## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n**Vital Signs:** BP 138/84, HR 76, RR 14, Temp 98.6\u00b0F, SpO2 99% RA\n\n**General:** Alert, oriented to person, place, and time. Appears appropriate but mildly anxious.\n\n**HEENT:** Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, reactive to light. Extraocular movements intact. No papilledema on fundoscopic exam.\n\n**Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.\n\n**Respiratory:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\n\n**Neurological:**\n- Mental Status: MMSE 29/30, mild difficulty with attention tasks\n- Cranial Nerves: II-XII intact\n- Motor: 5/5 strength throughout upper extremities, 5/5 left lower extremity, 4+/5 right lower extremity\n- Sensory: Intact to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception\n- Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric throughout except for 3+ at right patellar reflex\n- Coordination: Finger-to-nose intact, slight impairment in right heel-to-shin\n- Gait: Mild circumduction of right leg, otherwise stable\n\n## DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES\n\n**MRI Brain with and without contrast (09/10/2018):**\n- 4.2 cm extra-axial, dural-based mass along the left parasagittal/falx region\n- Homogeneous enhancement with contrast\n- Moderate surrounding edema with 4mm midline shift to the right\n- Mass effect on the left motor strip, particularly the leg area\n- Dural tail sign present\n- Radiographic features consistent with WHO Grade I meningioma\n\n**EEG (09/12/2018):**\n- Mild slowing over the left frontal region\n- No epileptiform discharges captured during recording\n\n**Laboratory Studies:**\n- CBC: Within normal limits\n- CMP: Within normal limits\n- HbA1c: 7.2%\n\n## IMPRESSION\n41-year-old female with a 4.2 cm left parasagittal/falx meningioma (WHO Grade I by radiographic criteria) causing mild right leg weakness, headaches, and one documented focal seizure. The tumor is positioned adjacent to the motor strip controlling the right lower extremity, which explains the presenting symptoms. Given the patient's stable neurological status, controlled comorbidities, and strong desire to minimize disruption to her professional and family life, a conservative management approach is recommended at this time.\n\n## PLAN\nAfter thorough discussion of management options including observation versus surgical resection, patient expresses preference for non-surgical management if deemed safe. Given her relatively stable neurological status and the location of the tumor, I believe a watchful waiting approach is reasonable with the following management plan:\n\n1. **Anti-seizure medication:** Start levetiracetam 500mg BID to prevent further seizures.\n\n2. **Corticosteroids:** Trial of dexamethasone 4mg BID for 5 days, then taper to 2mg BID for 5 days, then discontinue to address peritumoral edema and potentially improve headaches and weakness.\n\n3. **Surveillance MRI:** Repeat MRI brain with and without contrast in 3 months to assess stability, then every 6 months for 2 years if stable.\n\n4. **Neurosurgical follow-up:** Return to clinic in 3 months with new imaging.\n\n5. **Neurology referral:** For formal seizure management assessment and potential EEG monitoring.\n\n6. **Occupational adjustments:** Recommended workplace accommodations including scheduled breaks, reduced screen time, and consideration of temporary reduction in hours during initial management period.\n\n7. **Diabetes management:** Continue current regimen with close monitoring of blood glucose levels, especially while on dexamethasone.\n\n8. **Blood pressure control:** Continue lisinopril with target BP <130/80.\n\n9. **Headache management:** Acetaminophen for breakthrough headaches, avoid NSAIDs due to potential bleeding risk.\n\n10. **Patient education:** Provided detailed information about meningiomas, typical growth patterns, warning signs requiring immediate medical attention.\n\nThe conservative approach is appropriate given the patient's stable neurological status and desire to maintain professional activities. However, I have counseled the patient that surgical intervention may become necessary if there is significant tumor growth, worsening neurological symptoms, or inadequate seizure control.\n\nKarnofsky Performance Status (KPS): 90 (Able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease)\n\nDr. Sarah Richardson, MD\nNeurosurgery\n\n---\n\n# NEUROSURGICAL FOLLOW-UP NOTE\n\n**Date of Service:** December 20, 2018\n\n**Patient:** 41-year-old female, Financial Analyst\n**MRN:** 78932145\n**Blood Type:** A\n**Attending Neurosurgeon:** Dr. Sarah Richardson\n\n## INTERVAL HISTORY\nPatient returns for 3-month follow-up.

Headaches are most severe in the morning and with positional changes, suggesting increased intracranial pressure. Patient reports right-sided facial numbness and tingling in V1 and V2 distribution. Over the past 3 weeks, she has experienced blurry vision in her right eye. Family members have noted mild right-sided proptosis. Patient reports difficulty concentrating at work as a financial analyst, which requires significant screen time and analytical thinking.\n\n### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n- History of migraine headaches since age 25, previously well-controlled with sumatriptan (discontinued during pregnancy)\n- Surgical removal of ovarian cyst 5 years ago\n- Currently 20 weeks pregnant with second child\n- No prior neurological disorders\n- No history of radiation exposure\n\n### FAMILY HISTORY\n- Mother with history of breast cancer\n- No family history of neurological disorders or brain tumors\n\n### SOCIAL HISTORY\n- Works as a financial analyst\n- Previously employed as a wine taster (currently abstaining from alcohol due to pregnancy)\n- No tobacco use\n- No recreational drug use\n\n### MEDICATIONS\n- Prenatal vitamins only\n- Discontinued sumatriptan due to pregnancy\n\n### PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n- Vital Signs: BP 118/76, HR 82, RR 16, Temp 37.0\u00b0C\n- General: Alert, oriented, in no acute distress\n- HEENT: Mild right-sided proptosis, right pupil with sluggish reaction to light\n- Neurological: \n  - CN V: Decreased sensation in V1 and V2 distribution on right\n  - CN II: Decreased visual acuity in right eye (20/40)\n  - Fundoscopic exam: Early papilledema noted\n  - Motor: 5/5 strength throughout\n  - Sensory: Intact to light touch except right facial area\n  - Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric\n  - Coordination: Intact\n  - Gait: Normal\n\n### DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES\n- **MRI Brain with and without contrast**: 3.1 cm homogeneously enhancing extra-axial mass arising from the right sphenoid wing with dural tail sign. Mass demonstrates significant mass effect on the right temporal lobe and mild compression of the right optic nerve. Features consistent with WHO Grade I meningioma.\n- **Ophthalmology Evaluation**: Confirms right visual field defect and early optic nerve compression.\n- **Laboratory Studies**: Within normal limits, consistent with pregnancy.\n\n### ASSESSMENT\n44-year-old pregnant female with a 3.1 cm right sphenoid wing meningioma (WHO Grade I) causing mass effect on the right temporal lobe and optic nerve, resulting in visual changes, headaches, and facial sensory disturbances.\n\n### PLAN\n1. **Urgent Surgical Intervention**: Given the location, size, and progressive neurological symptoms including visual changes, I recommend surgical resection despite pregnancy. The optimal timing would be during the second trimester (current stage) to minimize risks to both mother and fetus.\n2. **Preoperative Planning**:\n   - Neurosurgery and obstetrics co-management\n   - High-resolution neuronavigation protocol for surgical planning\n   - Fetal monitoring during procedure\n3. **Proposed Surgery**: Right frontotemporal craniotomy for Simpson Grade I-II resection of sphenoid wing meningioma\n4. **Timing**: Schedule within 2 weeks given progressive visual symptoms\n5. **Patient Education**: Discussed risks and benefits of surgical intervention during pregnancy versus observation. Emphasized risks of permanent visual loss and increased intracranial pressure if left untreated.\n6. **Follow-up**: Schedule for preoperative assessment in 1 week\n\n### DISCUSSION WITH PATIENT\nDetailed discussion held regarding the risks of surgery during pregnancy versus risks of observation. Given the location near the optic apparatus and progressive visual symptoms, proactive surgical intervention is strongly recommended despite pregnancy. Without intervention, there is significant risk of permanent visual loss and worsening neurological symptoms. Patient to discuss with family and return for preoperative assessment.\n\n**KPS Score: 80** - Normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease.\n\n---\n\n## PREOPERATIVE VISIT - May 22, 2014\n\n### SUBJECTIVE\nPatient returns after considering surgical options. Reports worsening of headaches and visual blurring in right eye. Now also notes occasional difficulty with fine motor tasks at work.

A right frontotemporal curvilinear incision was made, and a craniotomy flap was elevated. The dura was opened in a curved fashion.\n\nUpon exposure, a firm, well-circumscribed, reddish-gray mass was identified arising from the right sphenoid wing with extension toward the optic canal. The tumor was methodically debulked using microsurgical technique. The tumor was found to be moderately vascular but well-controlled with bipolar electrocautery.\n\nThe tumor was dissected from the surrounding brain parenchyma and optic nerve. Particular attention was paid to preserving the optic nerve and surrounding vasculature. The tumor was removed in its entirety with the exception of a small amount of tumor infiltrating the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus, which was coagulated (Simpson Grade II resection).\n\nThe dural attachment was thoroughly coagulated. Hemostasis was achieved. The dura was closed in a watertight fashion, the bone flap replaced and secured with titanium plates and screws. The scalp was closed in layers.\n\nIntraoperative fetal monitoring remained stable throughout the procedure with no signs of distress.\n\n### PATHOLOGY\nPreliminary: WHO Grade I meningioma, meningothelial subtype\n\n### PLAN\n1. Admit to Neurosurgical ICU for overnight monitoring\n2. Continue fetal monitoring for 48 hours\n3. Obstetrics consultation\n4. Early mobilization\n5.

        "conservative": "# NEUROSURGERY CLINICAL NOTE\n\n## INITIAL CONSULTATION\n**Date:** June 15, 2018\n**Patient:** 43-year-old female, blood type A\n**Occupation:** Software Developer\n\n### CHIEF COMPLAINT\nPatient presents with persistent headaches for 3 months, gradually increasing in frequency and intensity, intermittent dizziness, recent onset of blurred vision in right eye, occasional morning nausea, difficulty concentrating at work, mild right-sided facial numbness, and two episodes of loss of balance in the past month.\n\n### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nThe patient reports a 3-month history of progressively worsening headaches, different from her typical migraine pattern. Headaches are described as dull, constant pressure, predominantly in the right occipital region. Symptoms have begun to interfere with her work as a software developer, particularly affecting her ability to focus on computer screens for extended periods. Patient reports increased symptom severity in the morning or after prolonged computer use.\n\n### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n- Migraine headaches since age 25, previously well-controlled with sumatriptan\n- Iron-deficiency anemia, treated with supplements\n- Tonsillectomy at age 12\n- No prior neurological conditions\n- No history of radiation exposure\n- Family history of breast cancer in mother\n- Taking oral contraceptives for 15 years\n- Annual eye exams with no previous abnormalities until recent visit\n\n### IMAGING FINDINGS\n**MRI Brain with and without contrast (June 10, 2018):**\n- 3.1 cm extra-axial, dural-based mass arising from the right tentorial incisura\n- Homogeneous enhancement with contrast\n- Moderate mass effect on adjacent cerebellum and occipital lobe\n- No significant surrounding edema\n- Radiographic features consistent with WHO Grade I meningioma\n\n### ASSESSMENT\n43-year-old female software developer with a 3.1 cm right tentorial meningioma, likely WHO Grade I based on imaging characteristics. Symptoms are consistent with mass effect from the lesion, including headaches, visual changes, and mild cranial nerve involvement. The location at the tentorial incisura makes surgical approach challenging with potentially significant risks.\n\n### PLAN\nGiven the patient's relatively stable neurological status, occupation requiring cognitive function, and the challenging location of the meningioma, I recommend a conservative management approach with close monitoring:\n\n1. **Watchful waiting approach:**\n   - Repeat MRI brain with and without contrast in 3 months to establish growth pattern\n   - If stable, subsequent imaging every 6 months for 2 years, then annually if remains stable\n\n2. **Symptomatic management:**\n   - Discontinue oral contraceptives due to potential hormonal influence on meningioma\n   - Start dexamethasone 4mg daily for 7 days, then taper to address mass effect symptoms\n   - Continue sumatriptan for migraine headaches distinct from tumor-related headaches\n   - Referral to neuro-ophthalmology for baseline assessment and monitoring of visual symptoms\n\n3. **Work modifications:**\n   - Recommend ergonomic assessment of workstation\n   - Suggest 20-20-20 rule for screen time (every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds)\n   - Consider reduced hours temporarily if symptoms worsen with screen time\n\n4. **Patient education:**\n   - Discussed natural history of meningiomas, typically slow-growing\n   - Reviewed indications for potential intervention (significant growth, worsening symptoms)\n   - Explained risks/benefits of observation versus surgical intervention\n\n5. **Follow-up:**\n   - Neurosurgery clinic in 3 months with new imaging\n   - Sooner if new or worsening neurological symptoms develop\n\n**Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS):** 90 - Able to carry on normal activity; minor symptoms of disease.\n\n---\n\n## FOLLOW-UP VISIT\n**Date:** September 20, 2018\n**Patient:** 43-year-old female with right tentorial meningioma\n\n### INTERVAL HISTORY\nPatient reports improvement in headache frequency and intensity since starting dexamethasone and discontinuing oral contraceptives.

The conservative approach included:\n\n1. **Medical management** with anti-epileptic medication and intermittent steroids for symptom control\n2. **Regular imaging surveillance** with MRI initially at 3-month intervals, extended to 6-12 months with stability\n3. **Workplace accommodations** including reduced hours, ergonomic adjustments, and cognitive strategies\n4. **Preservation of quality of life** through symptom management and adaptation strategies\n\nWhen the tumor demonstrated progression with increasing symptoms and steroid dependence, stereotactic radiosurgery was chosen as a minimally invasive intervention. Following radiosurgery, the patient has shown good response with tumor size reduction and improved symptoms, allowing gradual return to modified work activities.\n\nThroughout the management course, the patient's KPS score ranged from 60 (at worst during tumor progression) to 90 (during periods of stability and after successful treatment response)."

Following induction of general anesthesia and placement of arterial line and Foley catheter, the right frontotemporal region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A curvilinear incision was made behind the hairline, and a right frontotemporal craniotomy was performed.\n\nUpon opening the dura, a firm, well-circumscribed, highly vascular extra-axial mass was identified arising from the right sphenoid wing. The tumor demonstrated significant hyperostosis of the sphenoid wing. Using microsurgical technique, the tumor was carefully dissected from surrounding brain parenchyma and critical neurovascular structures. The middle meningeal artery feeding the tumor was identified and coagulated. The tumor was noted to have minimal invasion into the cavernous sinus medially.\n\nSimpson Grade II resection was achieved with coagulation of the dural attachment. Hyperostotic bone was drilled away. Hemostasis was achieved, and the dura was closed in a watertight fashion. The bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates and screws. The wound was closed in layers, and a sterile dressing was applied.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the neurosurgical ICU in stable condition for postoperative monitoring.\n\n### PATHOLOGY (PRELIMINARY)\nMeningioma, WHO Grade I, with meningothelial features\n\n---\n\n## POST-OPERATIVE FOLLOW-UP - June 12, 2018 (2 weeks post-op)\n\n### SUBJECTIVE\nPatient reports significant improvement in headaches.

A conservative watchful waiting approach was initially implemented with periodic MRI monitoring. Over the first two years, the tumor showed slow growth with gradually worsening symptoms, managed with intermittent steroid therapy.\n\nBy late 2021, increased tumor growth and neurological deterioration necessitated intervention, and the patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery as a non-surgical management option. Following radiosurgery, the patient experienced excellent tumor response with gradual decrease in size and resolution of peritumoral edema. Neurological symptoms improved significantly, allowing for steroid discontinuation and partial return to work.\n\nThe patient's KPS score fluctuated throughout her course, starting at 90, decreasing to 70 during the period of tumor progression and steroid complications, and returning to 90 following successful radiosurgery response. This case demonstrates the effectiveness of a conservative approach with timely minimally invasive intervention when necessary, preserving quality of life while avoiding open surgical resection."

Tumor demonstrated areas of increased vascularity and focal areas of apparent brain invasion not evident on preoperative imaging. Superior sagittal sinus was partially invaded but patent. Simpson Grade II resection achieved.\n\n**DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:**\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, patient was positioned supine with head fixed in Mayfield pins. Neuronavigation was registered. Right parasagittal craniotomy was performed. Dura was opened in a cruciate fashion. Tumor was identified and internal debulking performed using ultrasonic aspirator. Careful microsurgical technique was used to separate tumor from adjacent cortex. Areas of apparent brain invasion were noted and sampled separately. Falx attachment was coagulated and resected. Portion attached to superior sagittal sinus was coagulated but left in situ to preserve sinus patency. Hemostasis was achieved. Dural closure was performed with duraplasty. Bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates. Wound was closed in layers.\n\n**COMPLICATIONS:** None\n\n**PATHOLOGY REPORT (PRELIMINARY):**\nAtypical meningioma (WHO Grade II) with increased mitotic activity (5 mitoses per 10 high-power fields), focal brain invasion, and increased cellularity.\n\n**PLAN:**\n1. Monitor in ICU overnight\n2. Continue Dexamethasone with taper\n3. Continue Levetiracetam\n4. Early mobilization\n5. Post-operative MRI within 48 hours\n6. Discussion of adjuvant treatment pending final pathology\n\n---\n\n### POST-OPERATIVE FOLLOW-UP - June 12, 2018 (2 weeks post-op)\n\n**SUBJECTIVE:**\nPatient reports improvement in headaches. Left leg weakness persists but is improving with physical therapy. No new seizures. No urinary incontinence. Complains of fatigue and surgical site discomfort.\n\n**OBJECTIVE:**\n- Vital signs stable\n- Wound healing well without signs of infection\n- Neurological exam: Left leg strength improved to 4+/5, gait steadier but still requires assistance\n- Post-operative MRI (May 31, 2018): Near-total resection with small residual tumor (7mm) along superior sagittal sinus. Resolution of midline shift. Minimal residual edema.\n- Final pathology confirms WHO Grade II (atypical) meningioma with brain invasion, 6 mitoses per 10 high-power fields, and MIB-1 labeling index of 8%.\n\n**ASSESSMENT:**\nPost-operative recovery from WHO Grade II parasagittal/falx meningioma with small residual tumor. Given the atypical features and residual tumor, there is higher risk of recurrence.\n\n**PLAN:**\n1. Refer to radiation oncology for consideration of adjuvant radiotherapy\n2. Continue Levetiracetam for 3 months\n3. Taper Dexamethasone over next 2 weeks\n4. Continue physical therapy for left leg weakness\n5. Follow-up MRI in 3 months\n6. Recommend 6-8 weeks off work with gradual return to duties as a baker with accommodations for standing/walking limitations\n\n**KPS Score:** 70 (Cares for self but unable to carry on normal activity or active work)\n\n---\n\n### FOLLOW-UP - September 18, 2018 (4 months post-op)\n\n**SUBJECTIVE:**\nPatient reports continued improvement.

Headaches differ from her typical migraine pattern. Patient reports right-sided facial numbness and paresthesia, particularly in the V2 distribution. She experienced one episode of focal seizure affecting her left arm approximately 2 weeks ago, lasting approximately 90 seconds without loss of consciousness. Family members note mild personality changes including increased irritability and decreased concentration over the past 2 months. Patient also reports occasional visual blurring when changing positions, suggesting possible increased intracranial pressure.\n\n### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n- History of medical radiation exposure to the head for severe acne treatment in adolescence\n- Migraine headaches controlled with sumatriptan\n- Gamma knife radiosurgery for right acoustic neuroma 8 years ago\n- Mild hypertension managed with lifestyle modifications\n- Seasonal allergies\n- Family history of brain tumors in maternal aunt\n\n### PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n- Vital signs: BP 138/84, HR 76, RR 16, Temp 36.8\u00b0C\n- Neurological examination: Alert and oriented x3\n- Cranial nerves: Decreased sensation in right V2 distribution, otherwise intact\n- Motor: 5/5 strength in all extremities\n- Sensory: Intact to light touch, pinprick, and proprioception\n- Cerebellar: No dysmetria or dysdiadochokinesia\n- Gait: Normal, no ataxia\n- Fundoscopic exam: Early papilledema noted bilaterally\n\n### IMAGING STUDIES\n**MRI Brain with and without contrast (June 10, 2018):**\n- 3.8 cm extra-axial, dural-based mass along the right convexity\n- Homogeneous enhancement with contrast\n- Significant mass effect on adjacent brain parenchyma with 4mm midline shift\n- Dural tail sign present\n- Hyperostosis of adjacent calvarium\n- Radiographic features consistent with WHO Grade I meningioma\n\n### ASSESSMENT\n44-year-old female with radiographic evidence of a large right convexity meningioma (3.8 cm), WHO Grade I, with significant mass effect and clinical symptoms including headaches, focal seizure, and right trigeminal neuropathy. Given her history of prior radiation exposure and previous gamma knife treatment for acoustic neuroma, patient is at increased risk for development of multiple meningiomas and potential for higher-grade lesions.\n\n### PLAN\n1. **Surgical Intervention**: Recommend early surgical resection given:\n   - Size of tumor (3.8 cm)\n   - Progressive neurological symptoms\n   - Evidence of increased intracranial pressure\n   - History of radiation exposure increases risk for aggressive behavior\n\n2. **Preoperative Management**:\n   - Start Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis\n   - Dexamethasone 4mg QID to reduce peritumoral edema\n   - Complete preoperative laboratory workup\n   - Neurocognitive assessment to establish baseline\n\n3. **Surgical Approach**:\n   - Right frontoparietal craniotomy for Simpson Grade I-II resection\n   - Neuronavigation-guided approach\n   - Intraoperative monitoring of motor and sensory evoked potentials\n   - Schedule surgery within 2 weeks\n\n4. **Patient Education**:\n   - Discussed risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery\n   - Explained potential impact on work as data scientist (cognitive function, screen time)\n   - Recommended 4-6 weeks off work post-surgery\n   - Patient understands and consents to proceed with surgical intervention\n\n### KPS SCORE: 90\nPatient is able to carry on normal activity with minor symptoms.\n\n---\n\n## OPERATIVE NOTE - June 26, 2018\n\n### PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nRight convexity meningioma, WHO Grade I (radiographic)\n\n### POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nRight convexity meningioma, WHO Grade I (pending pathology)\n\n### PROCEDURE PERFORMED\nRight frontoparietal craniotomy with Simpson Grade II resection of convexity meningioma\n\n### SURGICAL FINDINGS\n- 3.8 cm well-circumscribed, firm, extra-axial mass with dural attachment\n- Tumor was highly vascular with significant feeding vessels from the dura\n- Minimal invasion into overlying bone\n- Clear plane between tumor and underlying brain parenchyma\n- Gross total resection achieved with coagulation of dural attachment\n\n### ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\n350 mL\n\n### COMPLICATIONS\nNone\n\n### SURGICAL DETAILS\nPatient was positioned supine with head turned 30 degrees to the left. After registration of neuronavigation, a right frontoparietal craniotomy was performed. Upon dural opening, a well-circumscribed, firm, extra-axial mass was identified. Careful microdissection was performed to separate the tumor from the underlying cortex. The tumor was internally debulked, and the capsule was carefully dissected circumferentially. The dural attachment was thoroughly coagulated after tumor removal. Hemostasis was achieved. Dural closure was performed with a dural substitute. Bone flap was replaced and secured with titanium plates and screws. Layered closure of the scalp was performed.\n\n### PATHOLOGY (PRELIMINARY)\nMeningioma, WHO Grade I, meningothelial subtype\n\n### PLAN\n1. Continue Levetiracetam 500mg BID\n2. Dexamethasone taper over 10 days\n3. ICU monitoring overnight, then transfer to regular floor\n4. Early mobilization and physical therapy\n5. Follow-up MRI brain within 48 hours to assess extent of resection\n6. Discharge planning for anticipated dismissal on POD 3-4\n\n---\n\n## DISCHARGE SUMMARY - June 30, 2018\n\n### HOSPITAL COURSE\nPatient underwent successful right frontoparietal craniotomy with Simpson Grade II resection of convexity meningioma on June 26, 2018. Postoperative course was unremarkable. Post-operative MRI demonstrated gross total resection with no evidence of residual tumor. Patient experienced expected post-craniotomy headache, which improved with pain management. No new neurological deficits. Right-sided facial numbness improved but not completely resolved at time of discharge.\n\n### FINAL PATHOLOGY\nMeningioma, WHO Grade I, meningothelial variant\n- Ki-67 proliferation index: 3%\n- No evidence of brain invasion\n- Immunohistochemistry: Positive for EMA and progesterone receptors\n\n### DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS\n1.

        "conservative": "# NEUROSURGERY CLINICAL NOTES\n\n## INITIAL CONSULTATION\n**Date:** March 15, 2018\n**Patient:** 69-year-old male, blood type O\n**Occupation:** Stage artist\n**WHO Meningioma Grade:** WHO Grade I (Benign)\n\n### CHIEF COMPLAINT\nProgressive headaches over 3 months, right-sided weakness, difficulty with fine motor coordination, occasional confusion, word-finding difficulty, recent falls during performances, and visual disturbances including blurry vision in left visual field.\n\n### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nPatient is a 69-year-old male stage performer who presents with a 3-month history of progressive headaches, predominantly frontal and worse in the morning. He reports gradual development of right-sided weakness affecting both arm and leg, with particular difficulty performing fine motor tasks required for his stage performances. Patient notes occasional episodes of confusion and word-finding difficulties, which have impacted his ability to memorize and deliver lines. He has experienced several falls during recent performances and reports visual disturbances, specifically blurry vision in the left visual field.\n\n### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n- Hypertension for 15 years (currently on lisinopril 20mg daily)\n- BMI of 34.2 (Obesity Class I)\n- Obstructive sleep apnea diagnosed 5 years ago (uses CPAP nightly)\n- Hypercholesterolemia (on atorvastatin 40mg daily)\n- Mild osteoarthritis of the knees\n- Previous surgery for inguinal hernia repair 10 years ago\n- Family history of cardiovascular disease\n- 30 pack-year smoking history (quit 8 years ago)\n\n### IMAGING FINDINGS\nMRI reveals a 4.0 cm left frontal convexity meningioma with moderate surrounding edema. The lesion demonstrates typical meningioma characteristics with homogeneous enhancement, dural tail sign, and clear brain-tumor interface. No evidence of brain invasion or aggressive features. Mild mass effect on adjacent frontal lobe but no midline shift or ventricular compression.\n\n### PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n- Vital signs: BP 142/88, HR 78, RR 16, Temp 98.6\u00b0F, O2 sat 96% on room air\n- Alert and oriented x3, mild word-finding difficulties\n- Cranial nerves: Left homonymous hemianopsia, otherwise intact\n- Motor: Right-sided weakness (4/5 strength in right upper and lower extremities)\n- Sensory: Intact to light touch and pinprick\n- Coordination: Mild dysmetria with right-sided fine motor tasks\n- Gait: Slightly unsteady with mild right-sided circumduction\n\n### ASSESSMENT\n69-year-old male with a 4.0 cm left frontal convexity meningioma (WHO Grade I presumed based on imaging characteristics). Symptoms are consistent with mass effect from the tumor and surrounding edema. Given the patient's age, comorbidities, and occupation requiring fine motor skills, a careful consideration of management options is warranted.\n\n### MANAGEMENT PLAN\nAfter thorough discussion of treatment options including surgical resection, radiation therapy, and observation, we have elected to pursue a conservative management approach with watchful waiting for the following reasons:\n\n1. WHO Grade I meningiomas typically grow slowly (1-2 mm/year)\n2. Patient's age and multiple comorbidities increase surgical risks\n3. Location allows for close monitoring before significant neurological deterioration\n4. Patient's preference to avoid surgery if possible given his performance career\n\n**Specific recommendations:**\n1. Start dexamethasone 4mg BID for 1 week, then taper over 2 weeks to address edema and improve current symptoms\n2. Initiate levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis given tumor location\n3. Follow-up MRI in 3 months to establish growth rate\n4. Optimize management of hypertension, OSA, and hypercholesterolemia\n5. Occupational therapy referral for strategies to maintain fine motor skills for stage performance\n6. Physical therapy for gait training and fall prevention\n7. Close neurological monitoring with office visits every 3 months\n\n**KPS Score:** 80 (Normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease)\n\n---\n\n## FOLLOW-UP VISIT #1\n**Date:** June 20, 2018 (3 months after initial consultation)\n**WHO Meningioma Grade:** WHO Grade I\n\n### SUBJECTIVE\nPatient reports significant improvement in headaches following steroid treatment. Right-sided weakness persists but has improved slightly. He has been able to return to limited stage performances with accommodations. Still experiences occasional word-finding difficulties and mild visual disturbances but denies any new falls. Using CPAP consistently and compliant with all medications.\n\n### OBJECTIVE\n**Vital signs:** BP 138/84, HR 76, RR 16, O2 sat 97% on room air\n**Physical examination:**\n- Alert and oriented x3, occasional mild word-finding difficulty\n- Left homonymous hemianopsia improved but still present\n- Motor strength improved to 4+/5 in right upper and lower extremities\n- Gait shows mild improvement with less pronounced circumduction\n\n**Imaging:**\nMRI brain shows stable 4.0 cm left frontal convexity meningioma with decreased surrounding edema compared to previous scan. No evidence of tumor growth.\n\n### ASSESSMENT\n69-year-old male with stable WHO Grade I left frontal convexity meningioma. Symptomatic improvement likely due to reduction in peritumoral edema following steroid treatment. No evidence of tumor growth over 3-month period.\n\n### PLAN\n1. Continue conservative management with watchful waiting approach\n2. Discontinue dexamethasone as edema has improved\n3. Continue levetiracetam 500mg BID\n4. Follow-up MRI in 6 months\n5. Continue occupational and physical therapy\n6. Recommend workplace accommodations for stage performances\n7. Consider low-dose (0.5-1mg) dexamethasone before performances if symptoms worsen\n8.

Upon dural opening, a firm, well-circumscribed, highly vascular extra-axial mass was identified arising from the right sphenoid wing. The tumor demonstrated significant compression of the right temporal lobe with moderate surrounding edema. The tumor was carefully dissected from surrounding neurovascular structures including the optic nerve, cavernous sinus, and middle cerebral artery branches. Significant hyperostosis of the sphenoid wing was noted and drilled away. Near-total resection was achieved (Simpson Grade II) with a small amount of tumor left adherent to the cavernous sinus to avoid cranial nerve injury. Intraoperative neuromonitoring remained stable throughout the procedure. Hemostasis was achieved, dura was closed in a watertight fashion, and the bone flap was secured with titanium plates and screws. The wound was closed in layers.\n\n### ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\n450 mL\n\n### COMPLICATIONS\nNone\n\n### DISPOSITION\nPatient transferred to Neurosurgical ICU in stable condition.\n\n---\n\n## PATHOLOGY REPORT - October 2, 2018\n\n### SPECIMEN\nRight sphenoid wing meningioma\n\n### GROSS DESCRIPTION\nMultiple fragments of firm, tan-white tissue measuring 5.2 x 4.8 x 4.0 cm in aggregate.\n\n### MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION\nSections show a meningothelial neoplasm composed of whorls of uniform cells with oval nuclei, fine chromatin, and indistinct cell borders.

He reports right-sided weakness and gait disturbance that has interfered with his ability to work full days at his financial firm. Of particular concern is the recent onset of confusion and personality changes noted by his wife, a seizure episode two weeks ago, and urinary incontinence developing in the past week. These symptoms suggest a rapidly progressing intracranial lesion affecting the left parasagittal region.\n\n### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n- Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 12 years ago, managed with metformin and insulin\n- Hypertension for 10 years, treated with lisinopril\n- Obesity with BMI of 36\n- Hypercholesterolemia on atorvastatin\n- Sleep apnea using CPAP\n- Coronary stent placement 5 years ago\n- Mild diabetic nephropathy\n- No prior neurological conditions or brain injuries\n- Family history of cardiovascular disease but no brain tumors\n\n### PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n- Vital signs: BP 148/92, HR 84, RR 16, Temp 36.8\u00b0C\n- Neurological: Alert but intermittently confused. Right-sided weakness (4/5 strength in right upper and lower extremities). Mild ataxic gait. Hyperreflexia on right side. Positive Babinski sign on right.\n- Fundoscopic exam: Early papilledema noted\n\n### DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES\n**MRI Brain with and without contrast:** 5.4 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma in the left frontoparietal region with significant mass effect on the motor cortex and compression of the superior sagittal sinus. Moderate surrounding edema. Enhancement pattern consistent with meningioma.\n\n**CT Angiogram:** Confirms tumor blood supply primarily from the middle meningeal artery with potential involvement of the superior sagittal sinus.\n\n### ASSESSMENT\n65-year-old male with a large (5.4 cm) parasagittal/falx meningioma causing significant mass effect and progressive neurological symptoms. The tumor location and size are concerning for potential malignant features. WHO grade cannot be determined without histopathology, but radiographic features suggest at minimum a WHO Grade I meningioma with possibility of higher grade given the rapid symptom progression.\n\n### PLAN\n1. **Urgent Surgical Intervention:** Schedule for craniotomy and gross total resection within 1 week given progressive symptoms and size of lesion.\n2. **Pre-operative Management:**\n   - Start Dexamethasone 4mg IV q6h to reduce edema\n   - Levetiracetam 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis\n   - Optimize diabetes management pre-operatively with endocrinology consultation\n   - Cardiology clearance given history of coronary stent\n3. **Surgical Approach:** Left frontoparietal craniotomy with potential for superior sagittal sinus reconstruction if invasion is confirmed intraoperatively.\n4. **Post-operative Plan:** ICU monitoring, serial neurological exams, early physical therapy.\n5. **Patient Education:** Discussed surgical risks including stroke, bleeding, infection, seizures, and potential for incomplete resection if sinus involvement is extensive.\n\n**KPS Score: 70** - Cares for self but unable to carry on normal activity or do active work due to neurological symptoms.\n\n---\n\n## OPERATIVE NOTE - JUNE 22, 2018\n\n### PROCEDURE\nLeft frontoparietal craniotomy for resection of parasagittal/falx meningioma\n\n### FINDINGS\n- 5.4 cm well-circumscribed, firm extra-axial mass with dural attachment along the falx and parasagittal region\n- Tumor demonstrated moderate vascularity with primary supply from the middle meningeal artery\n- Partial invasion of the superior sagittal sinus anteriorly, but with preserved patency\n- Clear plane between tumor and brain parenchyma in most areas\n- Simpson Grade II resection achieved (gross total resection with coagulation of dural attachment)\n\n### SURGICAL PROCEDURE DETAILS\nUnder general anesthesia, a left frontoparietal craniotomy was performed. The tumor was identified and circumferentially dissected using microsurgical technique. The middle meningeal artery feeding vessels were coagulated early. The tumor was removed in piecemeal fashion with careful attention to the interface with the motor cortex. Partial invasion of the superior sagittal sinus was noted anteriorly, and this portion was carefully coagulated rather than resected to preserve sinus patency. Hemostasis was achieved, and the dura was closed with a pericranial graft. The bone flap was replaced, and the scalp was closed in layers.\n\n### ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\n450 mL\n\n### COMPLICATIONS\nNone during the procedure\n\n### PATHOLOGY (PRELIMINARY)\nSpecimens sent for frozen and permanent section.

Initial watchful waiting transitioned to stereotactic radiotherapy when the tumor showed progression. This approach considered his significant medical comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiac history) that substantially increased surgical risks. Management focused on symptom control, preservation of cognitive function critical for his occupation, and regular monitoring. The patient has maintained good functional status and quality of life without the risks of major surgery."

Tumor demonstrated moderate vascularity and partial invasion of the superior sagittal sinus wall. Gross total resection was achieved except for a small portion adherent to the superior sagittal sinus to preserve venous drainage.\n\n**Operative Description:**\nAfter positioning, registration, and sterile preparation, a left frontoparietal craniotomy was performed. Upon dural opening, the tumor was immediately visualized as a firm, grayish mass with significant vascularity. Careful microsurgical technique was employed to debulk the tumor internally, followed by circumferential dissection from surrounding brain parenchyma.
