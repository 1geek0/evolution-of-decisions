        "conservative": "# NEUROSURGERY CLINICAL NOTES\n\n## INITIAL CONSULTATION\n**Date:** April 15, 2018\n**Patient:** 50-year-old female, Data Scientist\n**Blood Type:** B\n**Chief Complaint:** Progressive headaches for 3 months, intermittent seizures, mild left leg weakness, episodes of confusion, memory lapses, visual disturbances\n\n### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nPatient presents with 3-month history of progressive headaches that are worse in the morning. She reports intermittent seizure activity starting approximately 6 weeks ago, characterized by focal onset with occasional secondary generalization. Patient has also noticed mild left leg weakness over the past month, occasional episodes of confusion, memory lapses, and transient visual disturbances including brief episodes of blurred vision.\n\n### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n- Pituitary adenoma treated with cranial radiation therapy 20 years ago\n- Subsequent gamma knife radiosurgery for the pituitary adenoma with complete resolution\n- Migraines since age 30\n- Mild hypertension controlled with lisinopril 10mg daily\n- Previous MRI 5 years ago showed no abnormalities\n- No family history of brain tumors\n\n### IMAGING FINDINGS\nMRI with and without contrast reveals a 4.2 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma in the right frontal region. The lesion demonstrates homogeneous enhancement with a dural tail sign. There is moderate surrounding edema with minimal mass effect on the adjacent brain parenchyma. No evidence of brain invasion, atypical features, or high cellularity.\n\n### ASSESSMENT\nWHO Grade I meningioma (presumptive radiological diagnosis), parasagittal/falx location, 4.2 cm. The tumor's location near the motor strip likely explains the left leg weakness. Morning headaches suggest increased intracranial pressure. Seizures are likely related to cortical irritation from the tumor.\n\n### PLAN\nGiven the patient's history of prior radiation exposure (a risk factor for meningioma development), relatively stable neurological status, and her preference to avoid surgery if possible, we will pursue a conservative approach with vigilant monitoring:\n\n1. **Seizure Management:** Start levetiracetam 500mg BID\n2. **Headache Management:** Acetaminophen as needed; avoid NSAIDs due to hypertension\n3. **Follow-up Imaging:** MRI brain with and without contrast in 3 months to establish growth rate\n4. **Neuropsychological Testing:** Baseline assessment to monitor cognitive function\n5. **Occupational Considerations:** Patient's work as a Data Scientist requires significant screen time and cognitive focus.

Initial conservative management with anti-seizure medications was pursued. Due to slow growth and persistent symptoms, stereotactic radiosurgery was performed in April 2021, resulting in tumor shrinkage to 3.7 cm and complete resolution of symptoms. Throughout treatment, special attention was paid to occupational considerations, with workplace accommodations enabling continued employment. The patient's KPS score improved from a low of 70 during periods of symptom exacerbation to 100 currently. She remains on anti-seizure medication with plans for potential reduction. This case demonstrates the effectiveness of a measured, conservative approach to meningioma management, particularly in patients with prior radiation exposure."

        "conservative": "# NEUROSURGERY CLINICAL NOTES\n\n## INITIAL CONSULTATION\n**Date:** May 15, 2018\n**Patient:** 66-year-old male, blood type O\n**Occupation:** Researcher\n**Chief Complaint:** Intermittent headaches for 3 months, mild right leg weakness, occasional episodes of confusion while working\n\n### HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nPatient is a 66-year-old right-handed male researcher who was found to have an incidental meningioma on MRI performed for evaluation of intermittent headaches. The patient reports 3-month history of dull, non-radiating headaches, typically occurring 2-3 times weekly, moderate intensity (5-6/10), relieved partially with acetaminophen. He also notes mild right leg weakness when climbing stairs and occasional episodes of confusion while working on research projects, lasting 1-2 minutes, with full recovery.\n\n### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n- Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 12 years ago, managed with metformin 1000mg BID and lifestyle modifications. Recent HbA1c: 7.1%\n- Hypertension for 8 years, controlled with lisinopril 10mg daily\n- Hypercholesterolemia on atorvastatin 20mg daily\n- Cataract surgery 2 years ago\n- No previous neurological disorders or brain injuries\n- No family history of brain tumors\n\n### IMAGING FINDINGS\n**MRI Brain with and without contrast (05/10/2018):**\n- 0.5 cm parasagittal/falx meningioma in the left frontal region\n- Minimal surrounding edema\n- No midline shift\n- No hydrocephalus\n- WHO Grade I meningioma features (based on radiological characteristics)\n\n### PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n**Vital Signs:** BP 138/82, HR 76, RR 16, Temp 97.8\u00b0F, O2 Sat 98% on RA\n**Neurological Exam:**\n- Alert and oriented x3\n- Cranial nerves II-XII intact\n- Motor: 5/5 strength in all extremities except 4+/5 in right lower extremity\n- Sensory: Intact to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception\n- Reflexes: 2+ and symmetric throughout\n- Coordination: Normal finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin\n- Gait: Mild hesitation with right leg, otherwise normal\n\n### ASSESSMENT\n66-year-old male researcher with incidental finding of a small (0.5 cm) parasagittal/falx meningioma, WHO Grade I (presumptive radiological diagnosis). The patient's symptoms of intermittent headaches, mild right leg weakness, and occasional confusion may be partially related to the meningioma, though the small size suggests other contributing factors should be considered, including his diabetes and hypertension.\n\n### PLAN\nGiven the small size of the meningioma, absence of significant mass effect, and the patient's comorbidities, I recommend a conservative approach with watchful waiting:\n\n1. Follow-up MRI in 3 months to establish growth pattern\n2. Neurocognitive assessment to establish baseline\n3. Optimize diabetes management in consultation with endocrinology\n4. Continue current hypertension management\n5. Headache management: Trial of prophylactic therapy with amitriptyline 10mg at bedtime\n6.

Patient enrolled in hospice care and passed away at home surrounded by family on January 10, 2022.\n\nFinal KPS: 10\n\n---\n\n## CASE SUMMARY\n\nThis 46-year-old male software developer initially presented with an incidentally discovered 33.5 mm parasagittal/falx meningioma. Despite early and aggressive surgical intervention with gross total resection, the tumor demonstrated progressive biological aggressiveness with recurrences showing histological progression from WHO Grade I to ultimately WHO Grade III (anaplastic) meningioma. \n\nThe patient underwent three craniotomies, conventional radiation therapy, carmustine wafer placement, hydroxyurea systemic therapy, and proton beam re-irradiation over a 6-year disease course. His occupational requirements as a software developer initially prompted aggressive intervention due to the visual and cognitive demands of his work.\n\nHis KPS scores demonstrated the typical trajectory of this aggressive disease variant:\n- Initial presentation: KPS 90\n- Post-initial surgery: KPS 70-90\n- After first recurrence: KPS 80\n- After progression to WHO Grade III: KPS 50-60\n- Terminal phase: KPS 10-30\n\nThis case highlights the unpredictable biological behavior of meningiomas and the importance of aggressive surveillance and multimodal treatment approaches, particularly in patients with occupations requiring high cognitive function.",

Initial watchful waiting was appropriate given the tumor's characteristics and minimal symptomatology. When the tumor demonstrated accelerated growth with neurological symptoms, we pivoted to medical management and ultimately stereotactic radiosurgery while avoiding open surgical intervention.\n\nKey factors in management decisions included:\n1. Patient's occupation requiring cognitive function preservation\n2. Proximity of tumor to eloquent motor cortex\n3. Patient's preference for quality of life preservation\n4. Favorable tumor characteristics on imaging\n5. Appropriate response to less invasive interventions\n\nThis case demonstrates the success of a measured, conservative approach to meningioma management with appropriate escalation of intervention when clinically indicated. The patient has maintained a high functional status with minimal impact on quality of life and occupational performance.\n\n**Current KPS Score: 90**\n(Range during treatment course: 70-90)"

Tumor demonstrated invasion of the superior sagittal sinus with partial occlusion. Tumor was adherent to the motor cortex with significant surrounding edema.\n\n**PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:**\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with head fixation in Mayfield pins. Neuronavigation was registered. A left parasagittal craniotomy was performed. Upon dural opening, a large, firm, and vascular meningioma was encountered. Careful microsurgical techniques were employed to develop the plane between tumor and brain parenchyma. The tumor demonstrated invasion of the superior sagittal sinus anteriorly. Complete resection of tumor component lateral to the sinus was achieved. Given the invasion of the superior sagittal sinus, a small portion of tumor (approximately 5mm) was left attached to the sinus to preserve venous drainage (Simpson Grade II resection). Meticulous hemostasis was achieved. Dural closure was performed with duraplasty. Bone flap was replaced and secured. Closure was performed in layers.\n\n**PATHOLOGY:** WHO Grade II atypical meningioma with increased mitotic activity (5 mitoses per 10 HPF), brain invasion, and focal necrosis.\n\n**PLAN:**\n1.

Initial watchful waiting approach was supplemented with stereotactic radiosurgery when mild progression was noted. The tumor has remained stable to slightly decreased in size following SRS, with one episode of radiation effect requiring temporary steroid treatment.\n\nThe conservative approach was particularly appropriate given:\n1. The patient's occupation requiring preserved cognitive function\n2. The critical location of the tumor near the superior sagittal sinus\n3. The typically slow-growing nature of WHO Grade I meningiomas\n4. The patient's preference for quality of life preservation\n\nThroughout the treatment course, KPS scores ranged from 70 (during periods of symptom exacerbation) to 90 (during periods of stability and improvement), demonstrating the effectiveness of the conservative management strategy in maintaining functional status.\n\nThe patient's history of radiation exposure as a teenager represents a potential risk factor for meningioma development and will be considered in long-term monitoring plans."

Has fully resumed both occupational roles with appropriate accommodations.\n\n### IMAGING\nMRI shows meningioma now measuring 0.8 cm, representing slow growth over 6-year monitoring period. No surrounding edema. Enhancement pattern unchanged, consistent with WHO Grade I meningioma.\n\n### ASSESSMENT\nSlow-growing convexity meningioma, WHO Grade I. Growth rate approximately 0.5 mm per year over entire monitoring period, consistent with benign behavior.\n\n### MANAGEMENT PLAN\n1. **Continue watchful waiting approach** given:\n   - Small size (under 1 cm)\n   - Slow growth rate\n   - Stable symptoms\n   - WHO Grade I radiographic characteristics\n2. **Next MRI in 12 months**\n3. **Symptom management:**\n   - Continue current migraine prophylaxis\n   - Maintain ergonomic workplace adjustments\n4. **Ongoing considerations:**\n   - Discussed pros/cons of continued observation vs. intervention\n   - Patient prefers continued conservative approach given stable quality of life\n   - Surgical intervention would be considered if:\n      * Significant growth acceleration\n      * Development of surrounding edema\n      * Progressive neurological symptoms clearly attributable to tumor\n\n### OCCUPATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\nPatient has successfully integrated management strategies into both career paths. Library has provided ergonomic workstation and flexible scheduling. Food critic assignments are scheduled to allow regular medication timing and meal patterns for diabetes management.\n\n**KPS Score:** 90 (Able to carry on normal activity with minor symptoms)\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY OF 6-YEAR MANAGEMENT COURSE\nThis 46-year-old female with a small right frontal convexity meningioma (WHO Grade I) has been successfully managed with a conservative, watchful waiting approach over a 6-year period. The lesion has demonstrated expected slow growth from 0.5 cm to 0.8 cm, without development of significant mass effect or edema. \n\nDespite an episode of viral meningitis in 2022 that temporarily exacerbated symptoms, the patient has maintained good quality of life and continued her dual careers as librarian and food critic with appropriate accommodations. Her diabetes remains well-controlled with medication and lifestyle management.\n\nThe patient's KPS score has ranged from 70 (during post-meningitis recovery) to 100 (at initial presentation), and currently stands at 90, reflecting her ability to maintain normal activities with only minor symptoms. This case demonstrates the appropriateness of conservative management for small, slow-growing WHO Grade I meningiomas in patients with minimal symptomatology directly attributable to the tumor."

A conservative management approach was initially pursued with anti-seizure medication and periodic monitoring. The tumor demonstrated periods of stability interspersed with slow growth, ultimately reaching 3.9 cm and causing increasing symptoms affecting her research work capacity.\n\nAfter multiple periods of growth despite conservative management, stereotactic radiosurgery was performed in late 2022. The patient has shown excellent response to radiosurgery with tumor regression to 3.2 cm and significant improvement in symptoms. Throughout her treatment course, work accommodations were implemented to preserve her professional identity as a researcher, transitioning from direct research activities to mentorship and advisory roles.\n\nThe patient's KPS score fluctuated between 60-90 throughout her treatment course, with lowest functioning immediately following radiosurgery and highest functioning during periods of tumor stability and after successful treatment response. Current KPS is 90, reflecting her successful adaptation to living with a chronic neurological condition while maintaining meaningful professional engagement."

The lesion has shown slow growth from 0.5 cm to 1.2 cm with development of mild to moderate visual symptoms. \n\nConservative management has been appropriate given:\n1. The patient's age and comorbidities\n2. The relatively small size of the meningioma\n3. The slow growth rate over most of the observation period\n4. The patient's preference for non-surgical approaches\n5. The successful management of symptoms through lifestyle modifications and medical management\n\nThe watchful waiting approach has included:\n- Regular MRI surveillance (adjusting frequency based on growth rate)\n- Ophthalmology monitoring of visual function\n- Optimization of diabetes control\n- Occupational adjustments to reduce physical and visual strain\n- Medication management of symptoms\n- Patient education and involvement in decision-making\n\nThe patient's KPS score has ranged from 90 (near normal function) to 70 (unable to work) throughout the course of management, currently stabilized at 75 with appropriate interventions.\n\nShould the patient's condition deteriorate, surgical options or stereotactic radiosurgery would be considered, but the conservative approach has thus far provided good quality of life while avoiding the risks of more aggressive intervention."

He also notes mild right-sided facial numbness and occasional dizziness upon positional changes. Headaches differ from his typical migraine pattern. Symptoms have not significantly affected his work performance as a librarian, though he reports needing more frequent breaks when shelving books.\n\n### PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n- Hypertension, controlled with lisinopril 10mg daily\n- Migraine headaches since age 40\n- Appendectomy at age 32\n- Family history of stroke (father)\n- No prior neurological disorders\n- No history of seizures\n- No prior radiation exposure to head\n\n### IMAGING STUDIES\nMRI Brain with and without contrast reveals a 0.5 cm extra-axial, homogeneously enhancing lesion along the right frontal convexity with dural tail sign, consistent with WHO Grade I meningioma. No significant mass effect on surrounding brain parenchyma. No evidence of edema.\n\n### ASSESSMENT\nRight frontal convexity meningioma, WHO Grade I, small size (0.5 cm) but potentially contributing to patient's headache symptoms and facial numbness.\n\n### PLAN\n1. Given my surgical philosophy of early intervention for meningiomas:\n   - Recommend surgical resection within next 3 months\n   - Discussed benefits of early intervention including complete removal while tumor is small and accessible\n   - Complete resection would likely result in Simpson Grade I removal with excellent prognosis\n2. Pre-surgical planning:\n   - Order high-resolution MRI with thin cuts through tumor region\n   - CT with bone windows to evaluate for potential hyperostosis\n   - Functional MRI to map proximity to motor/speech areas\n3. Discussed risks and benefits of surgery vs. observation\n4. Patient to consider options and follow up in 2 weeks for surgical planning\n5. Prescribed Topiramate 25mg daily for headache management in interim\n\n**KPS Score: 90** - Able to carry on normal activity with minor symptoms\n\n---\n\n## FOLLOW-UP VISIT - March 29, 2018\n\n### INTERVAL HISTORY\nPatient returns after considering treatment options. Reports headaches continue but are somewhat improved with Topiramate. Facial numbness unchanged.\n\n### DISCUSSION\nPatient has decided to proceed with surgical intervention. We discussed my recommendation for early surgical intervention given my belief that even small, presumably benign meningiomas can progress and become more challenging to treat over time. While observation would be reasonable given the small size, I believe proactive management is warranted given his symptoms.\n\n### PLAN\n1. Scheduled for right frontal craniotomy with image-guided meningioma resection on April 20, 2018\n2.

Over the 6-year surveillance period, the lesion has demonstrated minimal growth (0.5 cm to 0.6 cm) with long-term stability for the past 3 years.\n\nThe patient's initial symptoms of headaches have been effectively managed with migraine-specific treatment, supporting our assessment that they were not directly attributable to the small meningioma. The right-sided facial numbness has remained stable to slightly improved over the surveillance period.\n\nQuality of life has been preserved through this conservative approach, with particular improvement noted following retirement. The patient has experienced normal age-related health issues including a recent pneumonia requiring hospitalization, but these have not been related to the meningioma.\n\nThe watchful waiting approach with periodic MRI surveillance has proven appropriate for this patient, avoiding unnecessary surgical intervention for a small, slow-growing lesion. The patient's occupation as a librarian initially presented ergonomic challenges that were addressed through workplace modifications, and his eventual retirement has positively impacted his symptom profile.\n\nCurrent KPS score ranges from 70-100 depending on intercurrent illness, with a baseline of 90-100 when at his healthy baseline.\n\nThe plan is to continue conservative management with extended-interval MRI surveillance, maintaining focus on overall quality of life and symptom management."

Given the benign nature of the tumor and patient's preference, a conservative management approach was initially pursued with close monitoring.\n\nOver a 4-year watchful waiting period, the tumor demonstrated slow but progressive growth to 3.8 cm with gradual worsening of symptoms including headaches, visual disturbances, and cognitive effects impacting occupational function. When symptoms became steroid-dependent and quality of life was significantly affected (KPS declining to 70), fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy was pursued as a non-invasive intervention.\n\nThe patient has shown excellent response to radiation therapy with tumor regression to 3.2 cm over 15 months post-treatment. Neurological symptoms have stabilized with improvement in headaches and cognitive function, though anosmia remains complete. Patient has successfully returned to full-time work with accommodations.\n\nThis case demonstrates the value of conservative management with appropriate transition to non-surgical intervention when indicated by symptom progression. The patient's occupation as a software developer influenced management decisions, with particular attention to cognitive function, visual symptoms, and workplace accommodations. Long-term prognosis remains excellent with continued monitoring planned.\n\nCurrent KPS: 90"
