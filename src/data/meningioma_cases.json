Symptoms notably include:\n- Morning-predominant headaches (concerning for increased ICP)\n- Right-sided visual blurring\n- Right facial paresthesias\n- Balance disturbance\n- Cognitive changes affecting work performance\n- Personality changes noted by family\n\nThese symptoms significantly impact both occupations, particularly affecting computer work and restaurant reviewing duties requiring mobility.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY:\n- Controlled hypertension on lisinopril\n- Class I obesity\n- Migraine history\n- Prior cholecystectomy\nNo contributory family history of neurological conditions.\n\nIMAGING FINDINGS:\nURGENT MRI with contrast recommended to evaluate for:\n- Tumor size, location, and multiplicity\n- Peritumoral edema\n- Mass effect and midline shift\n- Vascular encasement\n- Dural tail sign\nAdditional imaging to include:\n- CT head with bone windows\n- MR venography\n- Functional MRI for surgical planning\n\nASSESSMENT:\nGiven the progressive symptomatology affecting multiple neurological domains and impact on occupational function, this presentation strongly suggests a WHO Grade II or higher meningioma requiring aggressive intervention. Symptoms indicate significant mass effect and possible cranial nerve involvement.\n\nTREATMENT PLAN:\n1. IMMEDIATE INTERVENTIONS:\n- Dexamethasone 4mg QID for edema management\n- Anti-epileptic prophylaxis\n- Urgent surgical planning\n\n2. SURGICAL RECOMMENDATION:\n- Early maximal safe resection\n- Image-guided surgery with intraoperative monitoring\n- Consider awake craniotomy depending on tumor location\n\n3. POST-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT:\n- Early post-op MRI within 24-48 hours\n- Consider adjuvant radiation based on WHO grade and extent of resection\n- Neuropsychological evaluation\n\n4. MONITORING PROTOCOL:\n- Monthly clinical evaluations for first 3 months\n- MRI q3 months for first year\n- Cognitive function assessments\n- Visual field testing\n- Balance assessment\n\nOCCUPATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n- Recommend immediate medical leave from both occupations\n- Computer work may require ergonomic modifications\n- Restaurant reviewing duties to be suspended until balance issues resolve\n- Gradual return-to-work protocol to be established post-surgery\n\nPROGNOSIS:\nGiven patient's age, functional status, and early intervention strategy, prognosis is guardedly optimistic with aggressive management.\n\nWHO GRADE: Suspected Grade II (pending surgical pathology)\nSimpson Grade goal: I or II\n\nFollow-up: Schedule for pre-operative evaluation within 1 week.\n\n[Electronic Signature]\nBoard-Certified Neurosurgeon\nDate/Time",
