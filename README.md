# Evolution of Decisions

Welcome to the **Evolution of Decisions** project! This innovative research tool is designed to explore the evolution of decision-making in the management of meningiomas. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), this project leverages modern web technologies to provide an interactive and insightful experience.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface**: Select patient cases and visualize treatment decisions.
- **Dynamic Probability Adjustments**: Adjust probabilities based on selected treatment approaches.
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Visualize decision paths using Mermaid.js.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless experience across devices.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you can run the development server using one of the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: Built with React and Next.js, utilizing TypeScript for type safety.
